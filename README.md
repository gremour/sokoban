# sokoban

Sokoban game.

Small project to train a guy who is new to programming on the real life example.

Run with

```
go run .
```

You'll need MinGW installed to compile pixel library as 
described [here](https://github.com/faiface/pixel#requirements).

You can draw your own levels, but game only reads file named `level`,
so please do some renaming.
